SafeSite AI is an advanced computer vision system designed to enhance workplace safety on construction and industrial sites. It goes beyond simple object detection by not only identifying the **presence** of six critical Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) items but also verifying their **correct placement** on individuals.

This multi-stage validation process, combining state-of-the-art detection with custom rule-based logic, significantly reduces false positives and provides a more accurate and reliable automated compliance monitoring solution.

## üéØ The Problem It Solves

SafeSite AI addresses critical gaps left by traditional PPE detection systems:

1.  **Lack of Pose-Based Verification**: Most systems detect a PPE item's presence but can't tell if it's being worn correctly. A helmet on the ground is not protecting a worker.
    -   **Our Solution**: We implement a positional rule engine, such as verifying a helmet's bounding box is correctly positioned above a person's head, to validate proper use and minimize false positives.

2.  **Poor Performance in Crowded Scenes**: In images with multiple workers, simple bounding boxes can fail to assign the correct PPE to the right person, leading to inaccurate compliance data.
    -   **Our Solution**: By using **R-CNN for instance segmentation**, our system can isolate individual PPE items even when they overlap, ensuring each piece of equipment is correctly attributed to the right person.

3.  **Limited PPE Coverage**: Many solutions focus only on helmets, ignoring other critical safety gear.
    -   **Our Solution**: Our model is trained to detect a comprehensive set of **six PPE classes**: helmets, gloves, boots, vests, glasses, and masks, providing a holistic view of site safety.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture & Workflow

The system processes images through a multi-stage pipeline to ensure accurate compliance assessment:

1.  **Image Ingestion**: The system takes static images as input, either from offline datasets or batch uploads for analysis.
2.  **Multi-Class Detection (YOLOv8)**: The powerful **YOLOv8** model performs the initial scan, identifying all six classes of PPE and generating bounding boxes.
3.  **Instance Segmentation (R-CNN)**: In complex scenes, an **R-CNN** model is used to create pixel-level masks for each detected item, enabling precise association with individuals.
4.  **Pose-Based Verification**: A custom logic layer checks the geometric relationship between a person and their PPE (e.g., is the helmet above the head?).
5.  **Compliance Evaluation Engine**: The final engine aggregates all data to make a compliance decision (Compliant / Non-Compliant) and generates an auditable log with an image ID and timestamp for each violation.

## üìä Performance Metrics

The model demonstrates strong performance in both detection and classification, validated by the following metrics:

| Metric | Score | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Precision** | 0.90 | 90% of the model's detections were correct, minimizing false alarms. |
| **Recall** | 0.85 | The model successfully identified 85% of all true PPE instances in the images. |
| **mAP@.50** | 0.95 | Excellent performance in detecting objects with a relaxed overlap threshold. |
| **mAP@.50-.95**| 0.70 | A stricter metric indicating solid performance, with room for improvement in precise localization. |

Training was successful, with all loss components (Box, Classification, DFL) showing consistent decreases on both training and validation sets, indicating robust learning.
